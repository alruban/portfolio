    description: `Orb is a Ethereum Network Service utility that I built to
    allow people to quickly search and filter ENS (.ens) domains. Around mid-2022
    there was a buzz for these domains, but the main ENS website lacked the
    functionality to quickly search for domains that may be valueable, and it
    also lacked any further information about the state of the domain. At the
    time there weren't many sites offering what this utility does, this was
    one of the first that allowed users to bulk search multiple URLs at once.
    Originally, you had to search .ens addresses one by one. Of course now,
    that's different - there's loads of sites that accomplish what Orb does,
    and more.`
